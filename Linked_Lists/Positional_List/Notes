Positional List
Finding a position within a data structure is imminent for its application. Using indices based approach is not efficient
as indices may change in real time as new elements get inserted or deleted.
That is why, a cursor can be implemented in the list to obtain its relevant position within the list.
and Hence, Positional list is implemented.
